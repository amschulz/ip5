This is a package for computing of predictions for selling data. Note we didn't have time to m

Dependencies:
The code was developed with a Jupyter Notebook (version 5.4.0). Moreover we use the following libraries.

Directories:
There is folder 'sarima' in which we placed all code concerning the SARIMA-model. 
The two files in the sarima-folder compute and analyse the results of our main-prediction. 
The comparison with client's prediction is also made in the analysis-file.
In the subfolder 'comparison' there is code for predictions and analysis of comparison we mentioned in our project-report.

In the folder 'grouping' is an own implemented algorithm for grouping the selling data according to the seasonal selling-behavior.
